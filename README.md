## 📍 Overview

**Countdown-death-app** is a web application inspired by the _Countdown_ movie. The app provides a unique experience where users can check their remaining time until "death" based on a fictional algorithm. It's designed to offer a blend of suspense and entertainment, creating an immersive atmosphere for users.

---

## 👾 Features

1. **Terms of Service Popup**:

   - Upon visiting the site for the first time, users are prompted to accept terms of service. The terms are intentionally long, and while they seem serious at first, it is revealed at the end that they are a joke.
   - If the user declines, the page closes immediately.
   - If the user accepts, the animation and sound effects are triggered.

2. **Animated Logo Screen**:

   - Once the terms are accepted, the logo animates from the right of the screen, moves toward the center, and fades out with a scream sound effect.
   - The logo appears only once per day when the user visits the site to avoid repetition.

3. **Color System**:

   - Numbers in the countdown are displayed in white as long as they are not equal to zero. When a number reaches zero (e.g., days, years), it turns red to emphasize the time running out.

4. **Time Tracking**:

   - The system saves the user’s last recorded time. Upon returning to the app, the previously displayed time is added to the current time, offering a realistic continuation of the countdown.

5. **Responsive Design**:

   - The app is designed for mobile and desktop users, ensuring a smooth user experience across all devices.

6. **Sanity Integration**:
   - Backend powered by Sanity.io for content management, allowing admins to easily control and update content.
   - Admin access is restricted to whitelisted users for added security.
